Swiftlet
========

[Swiftlet](http://swiftlet.org/) is quite possibly the smallest 
[MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) framework you'll ever 
use. And it's swift.

Installation in three easy steps
--------------------------------

* Step 1: Clone (or download and extract) Swiftlet into a directory on your PHP
  supported web server.
* Step 2: Congratulations, Swiftlet is now up and running.
* Step 3: There is no step 3.


Getting started: controllers and views
--------------------------------------

Let's create a page. Each page consists of a controller and at least one view.

The controller does most of the work; views should be limited to simple 
presentation logic (loops and switches).

**Controller `vendor/HelloWorld/Controllers/Foo.php`**

```php
<?php
namespace HelloWorld\Controllers;

class Foo extends \Swiftlet\Abstracts\Controller
{
	protected $title = 'Foo'; // Optional but usually desired 

	// Default action
	public function index(array $args = $args)
	{
		// Pass a variable to the view
		$this->view->helloWorld = 'Hello world!';
	}
}
```

Important: class names are written in 
[CamelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) and match their filename.


**View `views/foo.php`**

```php
<h1><?= $this->pageTitle ?></h1>

<p>
	<?= $this->helloWorld ?>
</p>
```

The controller can set variables directly on the view. Values are automatically 
made safe for use in HTML, use `$this->get('variable', false)` on values that 
should be treated as code.

You can now view the page by navigating to `http://<swiftlet>/foo` in your web
browser!

If you get a "404 Not Found" you will need to enable rewrites in the web server
configuration. Alternatively you can navigate to `http://<swiftlet>?q=foo`.

*Swiftlet can be invoked from the command line (e.g. to run cron jobs). Simply
run `php public/index.php -q foo`.*


Routing
-------

Notice how you can access the page at `/foo` by simply creating a controller 
named `Foo`. The application maps URLs to controllers, actions and arguments.

Consider this URL: `/foo/bar/baz/qux`

In this case `foo` becomes the name of the controller and view, `bar` the name 
of the action and `baz` and `qux` are arguments (accessible through the `$args`
variable in the controller).

If the controller or action is not specified they default to `index` (`/`
will call `index()` on `HelloWorld\Controller\Index`).

Underscores in the controller name are translated to directory separators, so
`/foo_bar` will point to `vendor/HelloWorld/Controllers/Foo/Bar.php`.

Dashes in routes are ignored; `/foo-bar/baz-qux` calls `bazqux()` in 
`vendor/HelloWorld/Controllers/Foobar.php`.


**Custom routes**

Automatic routing is convenient but more granular control is often desirable.
In these cases custom routes can be defined.

A route maps a URL to an action (method).

URL segments can be replaced with a "wildcard" placeholder (a variable name
prefixed with a colon). This value becomes available for use in the 
controller.

Consider this route: `bar/:qux`

Navigating to `<controller>/bar/something` matches this route. The value of 
`$args['qux']` becomes `something`.


```php
<?php
namespace HelloWorld\Controllers;

class Foo extends \Swiftlet\Abstracts\Controller
{
	protected $routes = array(
		'hello/world' => 'index',
		'bar/:qux'    => 'bar'
		);

	public function index(array $args = $args)
	{
		// You navigated to foo/hello/world
	}

	public function bar(array $args = $args)
	{
		// You navigated to foo/bar/<something>
		// $args['qux'] contains the second URL argument
	}
}
```


Actions and arguments
---------------------

Actions are methods of the controller. A common example might be `edit` or
`delete`:

`/blog/edit/1`

This will call the function `edit()` on `Blog` with `1` as an argument (the 
id of the blog post to edit).

Arguments can be accessed through `$this->app->getArgs()`.

To use a different view for a specific action you may change the value of 
`$this->view->name`. The view name is a filename relative to the `views` 
directory, without the `.php` suffix.


Models
------

Let's throw a model into the mix and update the controller.

**Model `vendor/HelloWorld/Models/Foo.php`**

```php
<?php
namespace HelloWorld\Models;

class Foo extends \Swiftlet\Abstracts\Model
{
	public function getHelloWorld()
	{
		return 'Hello world!';
	}
}
```

**Controller `vendor/HelloWorld/Controllers/Foo.php`**

```php
<?php
namespace HelloWorld\Controllers;

class Foo extends \Swiftlet\Abstracts\Controller
{
	protected $title = 'Foo';

	public function index()
	{
		// Get an instance of the Example class 
		// See vendor/HelloWorld/Models/Example.php
		$example = $this->app->getModel('example');

		$this->view->helloWorld = $example->getHelloWorld();
	}
}
```

A model typically represents data. This can be an entry in a database or an
object such as a user.

```php
<?php
$user = $this->app->getModel('user');

$user->setEmail('example@example.com');

$user->save();
```

Loading and saving data should almost always happen in a model. You can create 
as many models as you like; they aren't tied to specific controllers or views.


Plugins and hooks
-----------------

Plugins implement [hooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking). Hooks are entry
points for code that extends the application. Swiftlet has a few core hooks and 
additiontal ones can be registered pretty much anywhere using
`$this->app->registerHook($hookName, $controller, $view)`.  

**Plugin `vendor/HelloWorld/Plugins/Foo.php`**

```php
<?php
namespace HelloWorld\Plugins;

class Foo extends \Swiftlet\Abstracts\Plugin
{
	public function actionAfter()
	{
		// Overwrite our previously set "helloWorld" variable
		$this->view->helloWorld = 'Hi world!';
	}
}
```

This plugin implements the core `actionAfter` hook and changes the view 
variable `helloWorld` from our previous example to `Hi world!`.

Plugins don't need to be installed or activated, all files in the
`vendor/HelloWorld/Plugins/` directory are automatically included and their classes 
instantiated. Plugins are hooked in alphabetical order.

The core hooks are:

* `actionBefore`  
Called before each action

* `actionAfter` 
Called after each action


Libraries
---------

Reusable components such as code to send an email or generate a thumbnail image
should go in a separate library class.

```php
<?php
$email = $this->app->getLibrary('email');

$email->send($to, $subject, $message);
```


Configuration
-------------

No configuration is needed to run Swiftlet. If you're writing a model that
does require configuration, e.g. credentials to establish a database connection,
you may use the application's `setConfig` and `getConfig` methods:

```php
<?php
$this->app->setConfig('variable', 'value');

$value = $this->app->getConfig('variable');
```

Values can be set in `config/main.php` or a custom file.
